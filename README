A MacOS X startup item script to automatically start up Redis on system bootup.

By default the script assumes that Redis was installed with Homebrew and the 
binary is /usr/local/bin/redis-server, and that the config file is
/usr/local/etc/redis.conf.  You may change this in the script if yours differs.

But, this is a blatant ripoff of Ren√© Sprotte's MongoDB startup item:

Installation
============

1) Set Redis to run as a daemon in its config file.
2) Copy (as root) the folder redis to /Library/StartupItems
3) Restart your Mac
